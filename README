# Q : Currently, every time we send an SMS we also show notification "sending sms: .....".
       What should we add in our code-base so that when the SMS will get delivered, this notification's text will be changed to "sms sent: ......"?

## answer : this can be done in two steps:
1. in android's SmsManager, supply a PendingIntent for delivery,
    this intent will contains the notification id
2. add action to the broadcast receiver that will handle "receivedSms" action
